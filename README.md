Create a website with Next.JS/TypeScript about five places that you want to work at.

Overall the site looks good and functions as intended. However I notice that you aren't using routing, which I believe is an assignment requirement. Be sure to double check the requirements. Either way great, clean, simple design! Have a great break!
